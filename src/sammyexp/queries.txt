Pagination:

1) Add unique integer id to entries (auto-increment)

2) Initial data load
SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY id LIMIT $page_limit;

3) Save id of last visible entry $last_id

4) Once user scrolls to bottom, load more data starting from last id
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE id > $last_id ORDER BY id LIMIT $page_limit;

Improving filtering for comparison:

1) Work entirely in database - only load what we need!

2) Add a "silent" modified variable that defaults to false.

3) Flip this variable when changing classified variable.

3) When loading in modified entries, filter based on the silent variable.

4) Include logic for showing "true" or "false" on the left/right side.

SELECT * FROM genes WHERE modified is true
